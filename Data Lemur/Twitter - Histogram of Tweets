
For bucket you have to do counting 2 times as shown below grouping with two times.



SELECT TWEETNUM AS tweet_bucket, COUNT(user_id) AS users_num
FROM
(SELECT COUNT(tweet_id) AS TWEETNUM, user_id
FROM tweets
WHERE tweet_date BETWEEN '01/01/2022' AND '12/31/2022'
GROUP BY user_id) AS BUCKET
GROUP BY TWEETNUM

WITH BUCKET AS
(SELECT  user_id AS user_id, COUNT(tweet_id) AS tweetnums
FROM tweets
WHERE tweet_date BETWEEN '01/01/2022' AND '12/31/2022'
GROUP BY user_id)
SELECT tweetnums AS tweet_bucket, COUNT(user_id) AS users_num
FROM BUCKET
GROUP BY tweetnums
